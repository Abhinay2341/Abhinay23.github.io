              The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish. 

The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.

The action and stunt-work in this film are utterly spectacular. Few other films have ever managed to keep me on the edge of my seat this much during chases, and fight scenes. There are a number of reasons for this. Christopher Nolan clearly put a lot of work into the stunts in this film and it shows. Every jaw dropping explosion, or nail biting vehicle chase feels as if it is really happening and that you are experiencing it in real time with the characters. The music is undoubtedly some of the best I have ever heard in a film. The all time great film composer Hans Zimmer once again proves to be a master of his craft here, delivering a thoroughly blood pumping and epic musical score that enhances the action ten fold.

The storytelling is some of the best in the history of comic book filmmaking. It is dark, unforgettable, and exceptionally intricate. The film tackles very mature themes that are far beyond most comic book movies, such as the contrast between order and chaos, as well as whether superheroes are truly heroes or simply vigilantes. The characters are also ALL masterfully well written. Many of the characters, such as Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman, embark on some of the greatest and most thought provoking character arcs I have ever seen. The richly detailed world building surrounding Gotham city also helps to make the film feel remarkably immersive (especially for a superhero movie).

            <p class="content">
            	Christopher Nolan hopscotches across space and time in a visionary sci-fi trip that stirs the head and the heart in equal measure.
To infinity and beyond goes “Interstellar,” an exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan’s vast imagination that is at once a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us human. As visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done, the director’s ninth feature also proves more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies, touching on such eternal themes as the sacrifices parents make for their children (and vice versa) and the world we will leave for the next generation to inherit. An enormous undertaking that, like all the director’s best work, manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal, “Interstellar” reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside “The Wizard of Oz,” “2001,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “Gravity” in the canon of Hollywood’s visionary sci-fi head trips. Global box office returns should prove suitably rocket-powered.

                 I think it’s great. The script writing, even though is not exactly parallel to the novel, still conveys the same writing style that Chuck wrote in, that being a very poetic and a peculiarly descriptive way. I love each role and each actor that fills those roles, I think Edward Norton and Brad Pitt did a phenomenal job in showing both the narrator’s weaker sensitive side and his bold and masculine side in such contrasting ways which eventually blend together. The story is amazing, with a really interesting plot line that talks about masculinity and identity, which we have Chuck to praise for. Edward Norton’s narration throughout the film adds another layer of mental struggle and character to this narrator’s mind and to top it all off, we have Where is my mind by Pixies being played in the final scene as we watch Marla and the narrator close ends. I think it’s a must watch, and definitely deserves the recognition it gets. Ahead of its time.
